## about_VIPerms

# SHORT DESCRIPTION

VIPerms is a PowerCLI helper module which provides some useful commands for use with vSphere permissions.

# LONG DESCRIPTION

Currently there is no public API available on the vCenter server to manipulate
global permissions. However, it is possible to automate global permissions administrative tasks via web
requests to the Managed Object Browser (MOB).

Please note that manipulating global permissions in this way is not supported by VMware and you are using
this module at your own risk.
