# LONG DESCRIPTION

Currently there is no public API available on the vCenter server to manipulate
global permissions. However, it has been unofficially documented by people like
[William Lam](https://www.virtuallyghetto.com/2017/03/automating-vsphere-global-permissions-with-powercli.html)
that it is possible to automate global permissions administrative tasks via web
requests to the Managed Object Browser (MOB).
